Pizza was invented by a 1, 2 chef named 3.
To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of 4, and make a thin, round 5 4. 
Then you cover it with 5 sauce, 1 cheese, and fresh chopped 6.
Next you have to bake it in a very hot 4. 
When it is done, cut it into 7 8. 
Some kids like 9 pizza the best, my favorite is also 9 pizza.
If I could, I would eat pizza 7 times a day!
