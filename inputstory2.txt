Pizza was invented by a run, italian chef named Robert.
To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of glass, and make a thin, round throwing glass. 
Then you cover it with throwing sauce, run cheese, and fresh chopped glasses.
Next you have to bake it in a very hot glass. 
When it is done, cut it into 7 squares. 
Some kids like chips pizza the best, my favorite is also chips pizza.
If I could, I would eat pizza 7 times a day!
